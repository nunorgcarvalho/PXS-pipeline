# PXS Pipeline

## Input files:

Software needed (and specific version used; other versions may work too):

-   `R 4.1.2` with packages `tidyverse`, `data.table`, `callr`, and `ggrepel`

-   `BOLT-LMM v2.3.2`

-   `LDsc v1.0.1`

-   `PHESANT`: <https://github.com/MRCIEU/PHESANT>

Inside of `input_data/`:

-   `phenotypes.txt`: on each line, write the name of the phenotypes that an analysis should be performed on. Right now just T2D

-   `CRFs_table.txt`: table of clinical risk factors for each phenotype

-   `bolt.in_plink_but_not_imputed.FID_IID.978.txt`: list of missing imputed individuals generated by BOLT the first you run it. You can either remain your file to match the `978` number or manually edit the scripts to reference your specific file. (The `978` in this case refers to how many individuals are in the file, and is automatically named that way by BOLT).

-   `exposures.txt`: is automatically created by `prepare_exp_PXS_CRF.R`

External (path must be manually edited inside respective .R scripts):

-   `loc_pheno_full`: path to UKBB phenotype file containing all necessary fields and f.eid. Used in `generate_PXS_coeffs.R`

-   `loc_40PCs`: path to first 40 principal components of UKBB sample. Used in `generate_PXS_coeffs.R`

-   `dir_data_showcase`: path to directory containing the files `Data_Dictionary_Showcase.tsv` and `Codings.tsv` downloaded from <https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/exinfo.cgi?src=accessing_data_guide>. Define inside of `paths.R`

Define paths inside of `code/paths.R`

## Order of scripts to run (inside `code/`)

1.  `initial_setup.sh`: runs the R script `generate_PXS_coeffs.R` and then runs `compute_PXS_LM.R` for each disease

    -   `generate_PXS_coeffs.R`: formats the exposures correctly from the UK BioBank and runs an XWAS in order to get the PXS coefficients for chosen diseases
    -   `compute_PXS_LM.R`: computes the PXS for all individuals for the disease and saves phenotype file. Also makes a list of associated clinical risk factors, a list of associated exposures, and a list of individuals with missing data for any of those exposures

2.  Genome-wide association analyses (order does not matter)

    1.  `run_BOLT_exposures.sh`: runs BOLT-LMM on each disease-associated exposure
    2.  `run_BOLT_PXS.sh`: runs BOLT-LMM on the PXSs of the diseases, as well as the different definitions of T2D as generated in `generate_PXS_coeffs.R`

    -   run GWAS results through FUMA and place unzipped FUMA data in `~/scratch/FUMA_results/` for later analysis

3.  Genetic correlations (order does not matter)

    -   `run_genCorr_CRFs.sh`: run BOLT-REML (genetic correlation) for each PXS and its disease's clinical risk factors
    -   `run_genCorr_expos.sh`: run BOLT-REML (genetic correlation) for each PXS's exposures and its disease's clinical risk factors
    -   `run_genCorr_MAGIC.sh`: run LDsc genetic correlation for PXS_T2D and 4 MAGIC cohorts phenotypes

## Visualizing/Summarizing data (inside `code/`)

-   `aggregate_results.R`: extracts important results from and makes plots of BOLT-REML AND BOLT-LMM data for XWAS diseases and exposures
-   `analyze_FUMA.R`: script for analyzing FUMA analysis of GWAS results. Make sure to include MAGMA GTEx analysis in FUMA
